# nes-arduino
Using an original NES controller with an Arduino Pro Micro/Leonardo.

## Installation
Installation is easy. First, make sure you have the [ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) correctly set up. After that, just open the Arduino IDE, open the file, and select 'Upload' (or compile & upload it directly with `avrdude`).
